**Q.** I encountered a CREATE\_FAILED error when I launched the Quick Start. What should I do?

**A.** If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with **Rollback on failure** set to **No**. (This setting is under **Advanced** in the AWS CloudFormation console, **Options** page.) With this setting, the stack&#39;s state will be retained and the instance will be left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue. (You&#39;ll want to look at the log files in %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and C:\cfn\log.)

[IMPORTANT]
When you set **Rollback on failure** to **No** , you&#39;ll continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Please make sure to delete the stack when you&#39;ve finished troubleshooting.

**Q.** I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS Cloudformation templates.

**A.** We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the location we&#39;ve provided or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer, you might encounter template size limitations when you create the stack. For more information about AWS CloudFormation limits, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[_AWS documentation_].
