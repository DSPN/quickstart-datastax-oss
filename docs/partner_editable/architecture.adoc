.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-name} on AWS
image::../images/datastax-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.*

* A virtual private network (VPN) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*

* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A DevOps jump host node where you can use tools to help manage the cluster.

* In the private subnets:

** Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) seed nodes used to bootstrap the gossip process for new nodes joining a cluster. These nodes are the inital Amazon EC2 instances that are outside of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group that assists in bootstraping the cluster.

** Cassandra non-seed nodes (starting with the fourth node onwards) that are part of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. Note that making every node a seed node is not recommended because of increased maintenance and reduced gossip performance. Gossip optimization is not critical, but a small seed list is recommended nonetheless.

** Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group used for scaling {partner-product-name-short} nodes in the private subnets based on workload demand.

* An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket for storing the CloudFormation templates and scripts. 

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.
