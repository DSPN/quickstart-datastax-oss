image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*

In the public subnets:
- 10.0.128.0/19
- 10.0.144.0/19
- 10.0.160.0/19

In the private subnets:
- 10.0.0.0/19
- 10.0.32.0/19
- 10.0.64.0/19


* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Auto Scaling groups for scaling {partner-product-name-short} nodes in the private subnets.


* Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips
the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC
configuration.
