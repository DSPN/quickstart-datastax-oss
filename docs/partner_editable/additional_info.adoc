Apache Cassandra backs up data by taking a snapshot of all on-disk data files (SSTable files) stored in the data directory. You can take a snapshot of all keyspaces, a single keyspace, or a single table while the system is online. See https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/operating/backups.html[_Backing up and Restoring data_].
For storing the backups in AWS S3, see https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/backup-to-s3-cli/[_Backup to S3_]
