Cassandra backs up data by taking a snapshot of all on-disk data files (SSTable files) stored in the data directory. You can take a snapshot of all keyspaces, a single keyspace, or a single table while the system is online. For more information about backing up and storing data, see https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/operating/backups.html[Backups^] on the Cassandra documentation website.
For information about storing backups in Amazon S3, see https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/backup-to-s3-cli/[Batch upload files to the cloud^].
