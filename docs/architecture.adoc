Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with **default parameters** builds the following environment in the AWS Cloud.

*Figure 1: Quick Start architecture for Apache Cassandra on AWS*

The Quick Start sets up the following components. (The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks.)

- A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones. ^*^
- A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS. For more information about the VPC infrastructure, see the https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/vpc/[_Amazon VPC Quick Start_]. ^*^
- An Internet gateway to allow access to the Internet. ^*^
- Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound Internet access for resources in the private subnets. ^*^
- One EC2 instance in the public subnet running devOps apps, which can also be used as a jumpbox to ssh into Apache Cassandra nodes in the private subnet.
- Additional EC2 instances for Apache Cassandra nodes, depending on your Quick Start parameter settings. (By default, the Quick Start creates a 3 node Apache Cassandra cluster with each node in a private subnet).
- One Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) data volume per node instance deployed.
